# Plan

## Welcome Page 
- Welcome / explanation page

## Proof page
- This page will ask permission to know users location and the page will sy to press deny. Because this quiz is legit.

## Questions 
- Questions page like air quality, traffic etc.(MCQ)

## Reveal page
- Pull Location and display: "Based on your responses, we predice you are from" + Location.

- This should work 65% of the times. The rest, it should pick from a random list
